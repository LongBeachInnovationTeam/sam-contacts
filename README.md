# Stakeholder Asset Mapper (SAM)

A CRM web app built for the City of Long Beach's Innovation Team (i-team).

More detail and documentation to follow! We intend to make this CRM available and re-usable for other Bloomberg Philanthropies i-teams.

## RIP

App was decomissioned Fall 2016. Here be dragons, hacked together code, and sketchy plugins for those who attempt to get this running on a newer version of Meteor.
